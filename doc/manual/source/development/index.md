Bsd is developed on GitHub.
Check the [contributing guide](https://github.com/BasedLinux/bsd/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to get involved.

This chapter is a collection of guides for making changes to the code and documentation.

If you're not sure where to start, try to [compile Bsd from source](./building.md) and consider [making improvements to documentation](./documentation.md).
